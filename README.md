Run the Manager.py. It collects all the files from the repository and recieves code per each commit and calculates it on that basis. It puts them in a pipeline structure where the worker can access it one by one. Stores the results in DB using sqlite3 and plots the graphs for them.

Average Complexity is calculated using Lizard. Results will be stored in PNG file once it's run.
